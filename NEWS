Overview of changes in RaveModemFactory 1.16
---------------------------------------------

 * Update the logic to consider SIM cards being unlocked, to better handle the
   ones which expose more than one application in the same card. SIM card will
   be considered unlocked and ready only when one of either the USIM or the SIM
   applications is in Ready state.

---------------------------------------------

 * Added support for modems with multiple WWAN+QMI pairs, like the new Sierra
   Wireless MC7304/MC7354.


Overview of changes in RaveModemFactory 1.12.2
-----------------------------------------------

Bugfix release, including:

 * libqmi 1.6.2 also has "UIM Get Card Status" support, so use that version as
   base but still explicitly look for the method in the library (e.g. so that
   libqmi 1.8.0 gives an error).


Overview of changes in RaveModemFactory 1.12

Bugfix release, including:

 * Improved Unlock() and IsSimLocked() operations, checking not only the SIM PIN
   lock status, but also the overall SIM readiness status.
